# KPIs and Metrics

1. Which metric to use and what data to capture, solely depends upon to goal to be accomplished
2. [RICE (Reach-Impact-Confidence-Effort): Simple prioritization for product managers](https://bit.ly/2QJn3CA)
3. [Top 10 Metrics Every Product Manager Should Know &amp; Track](https://bit.ly/2lte5uo)
4. [15 Key Product Management Metrics and KPIs](https://bit.ly/2jZJG6w)
5. How do you monitor performance and success?
6. [Prioritization and Stakeholder Management](https://gitlab.com/Floydimus/PM/raw/master/Assets/Prioritization-and-Stakeholder-Management.pptx)

A professional product manager will have a strong set of key performance indicators (KPIs) that they will monitor in order to understand their position, growth, progress and success. There are four key categories to listen for, including business metrics, product usage metrics, product development metrics, and product quality metrics. Listen for a solid selection of the following KPIs:

1. **Revenues or bookings**: Top-line dollars that have committed to in conjunction with the sales team
2. **Funnel**: Sales in process
3. **Retention, attrition, churn, customer lifetime value**: Track the movement or flow of customers
4. **Customer counts**: Current customer base
5. **Velocity, time to revenue, on-boarding times**: Looking to accelerate revenue recognition and customer adoption
6. **Margins, gross margins, costs of goods sold (COGS), and operational costs of goods sold (OCOGS)**: Understanding the cost basis on which to calculate profitability
7. **Net promoter score (NPS) or customer satisfaction (CSAT)**: Subjective analysis of customer feedback
8. **Number of users per feature or transaction volumes**: Can track feature importance for prioritizing sprints, and can highlight value for marketing or competitive positioning
9. **Time to execute**: Records of time that functions take to perform, possibly indicating infrastructure or complex calculations which will result in customer complaints for poor performance
10. **On-time delivery**: Managing the roadmap and creating credibility—the integrity of the team will depend on delivering as expected, on-time
11. **Team velocity**: Monitoring team performance against sprint calculations using story points
12. **Resource availability**: Monitoring critical resource availability and planning appropriately for coverage
13. **Support tickets and escalations**: Monitoring the quality of the released product
14. **Testing or QA**: Monitoring the quality of the code going into test

As a follow up, ask them what they did when they found a KPI that was not moving in the right direction. Listen for an action plan that would include common sense root cause analysis, and some creative thinking to solve for an unexpected KPI.

Product managers should also be using KPIs to plan for growth, perhaps in their NetOps environments or of on-boarding resources to meet more demand. Likewise, if the support and maintenance metrics are reducing, look for an adjustment of engineering resources as an appropriate data-driven management decision.

# Tips and tricks

1. Start Medium or a blog. Product Manager is a critical thinker and the only way for thinkers to be understood and recognized is through writing.
2. [A Product Manager’s Guide to Saying No](https://bit.ly/37vfDXJ)
3. Feature flags and release trains
4. Self-service model eliminates hand offs. It is great for scaling but runs on trust. This model enables you to do things yourself. However, other teams support you.
5. Trust > Control. You get control indirectly via trust
6. If everything is under control then you are going too slow
7. Limit blast radius and roll out to 1% of users so not everybody is impacted. Therefore, whatever happens happens to small part of product to a small number of users for a short period
8. A product with zero bugs is a bad product.
9. Healthy culture helps heal the broken process
10. Objective decision making overpowers subjective opinions
11. Know how to solve the problem instead of knowing it all
12. Users are the best advocates for your product. An advocate brings other users in, resolves problems, and give you actionable feedback to improve your product.
13. The best way to turn a user into an advocate is to enhance the user in their context.  
    E.g.: Instead of &quot;I have a good camera&quot;, let the product make the user feel &quot;I&#39;m a good photographer!&quot;  
    How do you do that?  
        a. Reduce cognitive load inherent in using your product.  
        b. Cognitive load is anything that the user has to learn or keep constantly in mind to use your product.  
        E.g.: A radio with lots of clearly labelled buttons is better than a radio with one streamlined button that does everything (because you have to learn/remember how it is all done).  
        c. Reduce number of choices to be made. (Related to cognitive load above).  
        d. Habits/automated tasks.  
        e. Make it easier to focus. (Get past Brain&#39;s spam filter).  
14. Create a sympathetic product.  
        a. Do not make any encountered difficulties the user&#39;s fault.  
        b. Give users faith that you know what it is really like to figure out your product.  
        c. Design all aspects of the product, documentation, marketing, etc., to be in line with user&#39;s experiences.
15. A good product roadmap is a polestar for product teams. It keeps us connected to the longer-term vision so that we don’t get lost in the day-to-day. It’s the strategic counterpart to task lists and opportunity backlogs.
16. [Product Launches and Risk: A Tough Teacher](https://bit.ly/2SaLmbm)
17. Tracking competition by [Shashank Mehta](https://bit.ly/2wATUA7): Track their job openings. JDs tend to give an idea about their team structure, work type, area etc.
18. Pricing strategy thoughts by [Amul Badjatya](https://bit.ly/2TOaT9U)
    1. Elasticity curve
    2. Customized pricing according to who the customer is, what can we bundle to upsell/cross-sell stuff, when should we target him, with what message and what medium

# How to build a product

## The business works because

1. Keep the costs low
2. Have a highly technical team
3. Be passionate about the product

## Ask yourself

1. How serious is your problem?
2. How specifically are you solving the problem for first?
3. Solve a problem people need to solve regularly
4. How easy are your customers to find?
5. Does your MVP actually solve the problem?
6. Get users on your product early (you are not an artist)
7. Who are the most desperate customers, sell to them first. If it takes 10 months, they are not desperate
8. Whose business is going to go out of business, without your software?
9. Be weary of &#39;customers&#39; who are taking the piss and avoid them
10. Be cautious with your discounts. Use discounts for urgency but do not devalue your product/service

## Metrics

1. Super important: ensure your stats are part of the build process
2. Should be a sources of ideas for features and solutions
3. Google Analytics is not optimal; you need an events based analytics solution (Mix panel...) as well
4. Pick 5-6 simple stats to track, don&#39;t overload yourself
5. Ensure you are tracking if people are using product or not
6. Maintain a clear spec that you are building that all team members can refer to

## Dev cycles

You need to build many things because you do not know what will work. So having short dev cycles and a good technical team is crucial. In addition, getting feedback from quick, scrappy MVPs let you know what you should be building.

1. Keep them short
2. Have a single KPI that reflects how you are doing (Money if you charge/Usage if you do not)
3. Ensure everyone in the company knows what the KPI is and was
4. Brainstorm solutions (with metrics to support/destroy ideas)  
       a. Categorise: New Features &amp; Optimisations/Bug Features/Tests  
       b. Prioritise: Easy/Medium/Hard  
5. Decide  
       a. Which hard item with impact the KPI the most  
       b. Which Medium item...  
       c. Which Easy item...  
6. Create the spec for each item
7. Distribute tasks
8. Meet once a week or bi-weekly, enough time to get shit done

## Pivot or iterate

1. Give your product time be properly validated
2. Pivot: Changing problem or Customer
3. Iterate: Changing the solution
4. Identifying the problem is the genius
5. Don&#39;t be fake Steve Jobs; iterate and talk to customers
6. Ask a specific customer what they want and make it (if it makes sense for your KPI)

11. In Product Design or favourite Product question, it is also a good idea to prepare 1/2 products that are not well-known. If you're allowed to pick a product to discuss, it's a good idea to go for one of those - the interviewer has less information about it and it's easier for them to assess your approach as novel. Also, for well-know products, the interviewer has probably head the same ideas from dozens of candidates before, so it's hard for you to stand out.

## Miscellaneous

1. When launching a new feature, how do you manage risk?
2. How do you say no to people?

Of course, it matters the context, but in product world, it typically means a request is coming from a stakeholder for a new feature or a modified interaction. Ask yourself does it align to our vision? Does it align with our market segment&#39;s needs/jobs to be done? Does it align with our company&#39;s financial targets or objectives? If the answer is no to all of those - then it is important to understand what the requestor is trying to accomplish with this request. Is it lack of understanding of the above, or do they know something you do not know? Getting to that answer will dictate how you can answer.

It is important to find the underlying outcome they are driving with their request and letting them know how another feature is driving that or is planned to drive that.

Best to lead conversations with empathy and know the narrative you are driving. Always be prepared to include metrics/data to support your narrative.
